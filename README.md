# Chord Grid

Toolkit to create chord grids as Ted Greene used to use them. See here: https://www.tedgreene.com/images/lessons/students/PaulVachon/HowToReadTedGreeneChordDiagrams.pdf

Current status:

Specify song in yaml file and run the python script. It will produce a pdf containing the chord grid. For examples look at autumnleaves.yaml and autumnleaves.pdf
